## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

Initial public release, pre-alpha. One fluent C# architecture spec, two render targets:
deterministic enforcement and generated AI-agent context.

### Added

- The reified model and fluent builder (`Zphil.LoadBearing`, netstandard2.0): layers, scopes,
  and rules, each carrying a posture: `Enforce` (the law), `Migrate` (ratcheted tech debt with
  a grandfathered baseline), `Freeze` (contained legacy with "here be dragons" prose).
- Roslyn/MSBuildWorkspace extraction with `file:line` violation locations
  (`Zphil.LoadBearing.Roslyn`).
- The `loadbearing` global tool (`Zphil.LoadBearing.Cli`): `check` (with `--json` and the
  diff-aware `--diff-base` freeze tripwire), `graph`, `render` (the managed AGENTS.md block),
  `explain`, `status`, and `baseline` (`--init` / `--accept-reductions` / `--add`).
- MCP stdio server (`loadbearing mcp`): `arch_check`, `arch_status`, `arch_explain`,
  `arch_context`, `arch_graph` with CLI-identical output, plus the `derive_spec` onboarding
  prompt; ships as an MCP server package (`PackageType=McpServer`) with `.mcp/server.json`.
- xUnit adapter (`Zphil.LoadBearing.Xunit`): every rule in the spec as an individually named
  xUnit test, failure text identical to the CLI.
